By chance, I learned that Royal and Loyal are two different words.

- Royal: of the royal family, one who inherits the throne
- Loyal: faithful, one who is loyal

As derivatives, there are the words Royality and Loyality.
In Japanese, both are expressed as "ロイヤリティ" (royariti), so they seem to be used without distinction.

These are said to come from the Latin words Rex (king) and Lex (law).

Furthermore, as derivatives, there are Regal and Legal. Regal means "of the king" or "royal," while Legal means "legal" or "lawful."

I've learned something new again.
