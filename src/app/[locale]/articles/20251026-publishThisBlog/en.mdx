I originally built this blog last October. Later I realized that the i18n library I was using relied on middleware, which made things a bit cumbersome, so I decided not to publish it. Recently, I felt like building a blog again, so I made it buildable as a static site and deployed it to Cloudflare Pages.

It’s a complete coincidence that I’m back at it exactly a year later—maybe there’s something about October that makes me want to build a blog.

I plan to use this as a place to jot down small ideas. I don’t have any concrete plans right now, though.

The Like button is just a counter, the Share button isn’t implemented yet, and the design is pretty rough—I probably should tidy those up, but they aren’t a high priority, so I’m a bit torn.
