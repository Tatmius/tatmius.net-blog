# Getting Started with Next.js

_October 10, 2024_

This is my first post. This blog is created using Next.js with next-intl/mdx.

## What I wanted to do

There are several blog platforms or micro CMSs. However, I wanted to create a blog which have very interactive pages.
To do that, I needed a way to render a interactive components.
I'm not sure if I can call it micro CMS but it seems to be very comprehensive.
And I assume that my pace of writing blog posts will be very slow. So I thought it would be better to implement blog without CMS or database.
That's why I create my blog just with Next.js and next-intl/mdx.
The every blog posts are just mdx files and it's in the nextjs project.

## Setting Up Your First Next.js Project

To create a new Next.js project, you can use the following command:

```bash
