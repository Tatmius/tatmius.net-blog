I decided to create a blog. Since I probably won't post very often and I wanted to make a blog with interactive elements, I chose to build it using Next.js and next-intl/mdx instead of micro CMS.

Initially, I planned to host it on Cloudflare Pages. However, due to compatibility issues between next-intl and Cloudflare Pages (which requires static rendering), I abandoned that idea and decided to host it on my home server instead.

In the future, if the number of articles increases, I might switch to micro CMS. At this point, though, I can't really imagine how that integration would work. I do think that having features like tagging might be beneficial, but it seems complicated, so I'll leave that for another time.

## Development Process Notes

This is not a detailed guide, so please refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Tatmius/tatmius.net-blog) for more specific information.

1. Project Creation

```bash
npx create-next-app {project-name}
```

2. Project with next-intl installation

Basically, I am following the method [next-intl and app router](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs/getting-started/app-router/with-i18n-routing).

```bash
cd {project-name}
npm install next-intl
```

Regarding directory structure, the documentation suggests creating a `messages` directory at the same level as `src` and placing translation files inside it. However, in this case, we are placing translation files related to the blog, such as header links, in `src/i18n/messages`.

Blog articles are stored in `src/app/[locale]/articles/[slug]/[locale].mdx` files, each with its own translation file in the corresponding directory.

This results in the following file structure:

```bash
├── next.config.mjs
└── src
    ├── i18n
    │   ├── messages
    │   │   ├── en.json
    │   │   └── ja.json
    │   ├── routing.ts
    │   └── request.ts
    ├── middleware.ts
    └── app
        └── [locale]
            ├── layout.tsx
            └── page.tsx
            └── articles
                └── [slug]
                    └── page.tsx
                └── [それぞれの記事]
                    └── [locale].mdx
```

3. routing.ts, request.ts, middleware.ts creation

I am copying the code from the documentation. I am changing the import path for the locale in request.ts.

↓ src/i18n/routing.ts

```ts src/i18n/routing.ts
import { defineRouting } from "next-intl/routing";
import { createSharedPathnamesNavigation } from "next-intl/navigation";

export const routing = defineRouting({
  // A list of all locales that are supported
  locales: ["en", "ja"],

  // Used when no locale matches
  defaultLocale: "en",
});

// Lightweight wrappers around Next.js' navigation APIs
// that will consider the routing configuration
export const { Link, redirect, usePathname, useRouter } =
  createSharedPathnamesNavigation(routing);
```

↓ src/i18n/request.ts

```ts src/i18n/request.ts
import { notFound } from "next/navigation";
import { getRequestConfig } from "next-intl/server";
import { routing } from "./routing";

export default getRequestConfig(async ({ locale }) => {
  // Validate that the incoming `locale` parameter is valid
  if (!routing.locales.includes(locale as any)) notFound();

  return {
    messages: (await import(`./messages/${locale}.json`)).default,
  };
});
```

↓ src/middleware.ts

```ts src/middleware.ts
import createMiddleware from "next-intl/middleware";
import { routing } from "./i18n/routing";

export default createMiddleware(routing);

export const config = {
  // Match only internationalized pathnames
  matcher: ["/", "/(ja|en)/:path*"],
};
```

## MDX Settings

I am following the official documentation [next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs/environments/mdx](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/docs/environments/mdx). I also created `src/components/MdxWrapper.tsx` for rendering MDX files (otherwise, CSS wouldn't work properly).

I am installing the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @types/mdx
npm install rehype-highlight highlight.js
```

I am adding the following `mdx-components.tsx` to `/src`:

```tsx src/mdx-components.tsx
import type { MDXComponents } from "mdx/types";

export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
  return {
    ...components,
  };
}
```

I am updating `next.config.mjs` to include next-intl and MDX:

```tsx next.config.mjs
import createNextIntlPlugin from "next-intl/plugin";
import createMDX from "@next/mdx";
import remarkGfm from "remark-gfm";
import rehypeHighlight from "rehype-highlight";

const withNextIntl = createNextIntlPlugin();

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "mdx", "ts", "tsx"],
};

const withMDX = createMDX({
  // Add markdown plugins here, as desired
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
    rehypePlugins: [rehypeHighlight],
  },
});

export default withNextIntl(withMDX(nextConfig));
```

I created `MdxWrapper.tsx` to fix the MDX CSS issue:

```tsx src/components/MdxWrapper.tsx
import React from "react";
import "highlight.js/styles/github-dark.css";

interface MdxWrapperProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export function MdxWrapper({ children }: MdxWrapperProps) {
  return (
    <div className="prose prose-custom dark:prose-custom-dark prose-sm sm:prose sm:max-w-none md:prose-base lg:prose-lg max-w-none mx-4 sm:mx-6 md:mx-12 lg:mx-24 xl:mx-60 mt-4">
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

This blog was basically generated by V0 (next-intl and MDX related parts were done by reading the documentation). It's fascinating.
